[Comparison between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`]

`package.json` and `package-lock.json` are both files used in Node.js managed by npm, but they serve differnet purposes.


1. package.json:
	- It is the manifest file for a Node.js project.
	- It contains metadata about the project, such as the project name, version, description, entry points, dependencies, scripts, and toher configurations.
	- Developers manually edit this file to add or update dependencies, scripts, and other project-related informaiton.
	- It is meant to be human-readable and editable.

2. package-lock.json:
	- Introduced in npm 5, it is automatically generated and updated by npm whenever the `npm install` command is run.
	- It is a detailed, machine-readable representation of the exact tree of dependencies in a project, including the specific version numbers of each package and their dependencies.
	- It helps in achieving deterministic and reproducible builds by locking down the versions of all installed packages, ensuring that the same versions are installed across different environments.
	- It includes information about the integrity of the installed packages to ensure they match the expected checksums.
	- Developers typically do not edit this file manually.

The `package-lock.json` file is crucial for ensuring consistency in a project's dependencies across different development machines and environments. It helps to prevent the "works on my machine" problem by providing a clear and unambiguous snapshot of the dependency tree. When you share your project with others or deploy it to differnt enviornments, the `package-lock.json` file ensures that everyone gets the same set of dependencies with the same versions. 

[package-lock.json]

The `package-lock.json` file is a key component of npm's approach to package management and dependency resolution. It was introduced to adress certain challenges and improve the consistency and reliability of package installations in Node.js projects. 

1. Dependency Resolution:
	- `package-lcok.json` provides a detailed, nested representation of the entire dependency tree for a project.
	- It includes information about the specific version of each package and its dependencies, ensuring that the same versions are installed across different machines.
2. Deterministic Builds:
	- One of the main goals of `package-lock.json` is to enable deterministic and reproducible builds.
	- By locking down the versions of all installed packages, developers can ensure that the project can be built and run consistently across different environments.
3. Integrity Checks:
	- `package-lock.json` includes information about the integrity of the installed packages. Each package's integrity is a checksum caculated based on the package contents.
	- When packages are installed, npm verifies that the calculated integrity matches the expected value. This helps to ensure that the packages have not been tampered with.
4. Faster and Reliable Installs:
	- With `package-lock.json`, npm can perform faster and more reliable installations. It can use the information in the lock file to skip unnecessary network requests and avoid resolving dependency verions repeatedly.
5. Offline Installations:
	- `package-lock.json` enables offline installations by providing a complete snapshot of the dependency tree and the necessary package tarballs.
	- Developers can use the `npm ci` command to install dependencies based on the lock file, which is especially useful in continuous integration (CI) environments.
6. Generated Automatically:
	- Developers typically do not need to edit `package-lock.json` manually. It is generated and updated automatically by npm whenever the `npm install` or `npm update` command is executed.
	- Manual edits to this file are discouraged, as npm is designed to manage it.
7. Version Conflicts:
	- If there are conflicting versions of dependencies specified in the `package-json` file, npm uses the resolutions in the `package-lock.json` file to resolve those conflicts and ensure a consistent set of versions.\
